## Git as a Content Manager
Git is fundamentally a **content-addressable file system**. Rather than tracking file names, That means Git stores and retrieves content using a key-value data structure, Git identifies content using a **SHA-1 hash**, making it efficient, immutable, and storage-friendly.

### What is Content Addressability?
- Content-addressability means that **data is referenced by its hash value rather than by filename**.
- Every object in Git  (blob, tree, commit, tag) is stored under a **SHA-1 hash**, making it immutable, ensuring its uniqueness and preventing redundancy.
- This approach ensures **integrity**: identical content will always have the same hash.

---

## How Git Uses SHA-1 Hashing
Git assigns a **SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) hash** to every object it stores, making it a **distributed and cryptographically secure system**. A SHA-1 hash is a 40-character hexadecimal string, representing a 160-bit digest of input data.

### Example of SHA-1 Hash in Git
```bash
echo "Hello World" | git hash-object --stdin
```
Output:
```nginx
557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
```
- The `git hash-object` command computes the SHA-1 hash of "Hello World", ensuring idempotency—this command will always produce the same hash for the same input.
- This hash is the identifier that Git will use to store the object. If the content is modified, **a completely different SHA-1 hash will be generated**.

### Why SHA-1?
- **Ensures integrity**: Any alteration changes the hash.
- **Efficient deduplication**: Identical files are stored once, saving space.
- **Fast lookup**: SHA-1 allows Git to quickly retrieve content.

---

## The Git Object Model
Git stores content as objects in the `.git/objects/` directory. These objects are compressed, stored, and referenced via SHA-1 hashes. Git stores content in **four object types**, forming the foundation of its version control system.

### Four Types of Objects in Git
| Object Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Blob**  | Stores raw file contents  (not filenames or metadata). |
| **Tree**  | Represents a directory structure (links blobs and trees). |
| **Commit** | Points to a tree and includes metadata (author, message, parent commit, etc.). |
| **Tag**    | Stores referenceable tags for commits (annotated tags). |

### Example: Storing a Blob in Git
```bash
echo "Hello World" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```
Output:
```nginx
557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
```
- This command **stores** "Hello World" inside `.git/objects/` and assigns it a **SHA-1 hash**. The `-w` flag writes the object into Git’s object database.
- The blob **does not track filenames**, only raw content. The object is now stored inside `.git/objects/55/7db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238`.

### To retrieve the content, use:

```bash
git cat-file -p 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
```

### Output:

```nginx
Hello World
```

## How Git Ensures Data Integrity
Git ensures data integrity using SHA-1 hashing, immutability, object compression, and content deduplication.

### Mechanisms Ensuring Data Integrity
- **SHA-1 hashing** guarantees uniqueness.
  - Every object in Git is identified by a 160-bit SHA-1 hash.
  - Any modification to an object results in a completely new hash.
  - This prevents accidental overwrites or corruption.
- **Delta compression** reduces redundancy.
  - Git compresses objects and stores differences (deltas) rather than full copies.
  - `git gc` (garbage collection) optimizes this process for large repositories.
- **Git’s immutable data model** prevents accidental corruption.
- **Verifying Repository Integrity** prevents accidental corruption.
  - Detects missing objects or corruption.
    ```bash
    git fsck --full
    ```

### Example: Checking an Object's Type
```bash
git cat-file -t <hash>
```
### Output:

```nginx
blob
```

---

## Git’s Plumbing vs. Porcelain Commands
Git provides **two levels of commands**:

### Plumbing Commands (Low-Level)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git hash-object` | Computes and writes SHA-1 hash for content. |
| `git cat-file` | Displays object content by SHA-1 hash. |
| `git rev-parse` | Retrieves commit hashes and refs. |
| `git update-index` | Stages files manually into Git’s index. |
| `git write-tree` | Creates a tree object from the index. |

### Porcelain Commands (High-Level)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `git commit` | Creates a commit object with metadata. |
| `git add` | Stages files. |
| `git status` | Displays working directory status. |
| `git checkout` | Switches branches or restores files. |

---

## How Git Uses SHA-1 for Commit History
A **Git commit** is essentially a SHA-1 hash that represents the project state at a specific time. The commit includes a tree (file structure), parent commit(s), and metadata.

Example:
```bash
git log --pretty=raw
```
Output:
```
commit 9fceb02b21337d3025f69e22f68c82d20a000000
tree 36b74b3b8f6a...
parent cf23df2207d9...
author John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
committer John Doe <johndoe@example.com>
```
- **Commit SHA-1**: Identifies the commit.
- **Tree SHA-1**: Represents the directory structure.
- **Parent SHA-1**: Tracks commit history.

---

## SHA-1 Collision Resistance in Git
- **Git uses additional security mechanisms** to detect hash collisions.
- Git has moved towards **SHA-256 support** to further enhance security. Git now supports SHA-256 hashes (`git init --object-format=sha256`).
- `git fsck` ensures object integrity.
-  **Git content structure**: Even if a SHA-1 collision were found, Git’s reliance on tree structures and commit history prevents serious exploits.

---

## Summary: Why Git is a Content Manager
- **Git stores and retrieves data based on SHA-1 hashes**,  acting as a key-value content store.
- **Content-addressable storage** ensures deduplication and efficiency.
- **Plumbing commands** allow direct interaction with the object storage.
- **Git’s object model (blobs, trees, commits, tags) enables version tracking.**
- **Commit history is a chain of hashes**, creating an immutable ledger of project changes.

## git hash-object: A Low-Level Command

### Understanding `git hash-object`
Git's `hash-object` command computes a **SHA-1 hash** for given content, allowing it to be stored in Git’s object database. It is a **plumbing command**, meaning it operates at a low level and does not track files.

### Key Properties:
- **Can be used outside of a Git repository.**
- **Idempotent:** Given the same input, it will always return the same SHA-1 hash.
- Supports **writing data to Git’s object store** (`-w` flag).
- Stores objects in compressed format (`zlib`).


### Example 1: Running `hash-object` Outside a Git Repository
```bash
echo "Hello Git" | git hash-object --stdin
```
Output:
```nginx
8cf2d8a03c123f8824ac46aa20a6b924ad44f0c8
```
- This command generates a **SHA-1 hash** but does **not store** it.

### Example 2: Running `hash-object` Inside a Git Repository

- **Initialize a Git repository**

    ```bash
    mkdir my-repo && cd my-repo
    git init
    ```
- **Generate and store an object in `.git/objects`**:

    ```bash
    echo "Hello Git" | git hash-object -w --stdin
    ```
    Output:
    ```nginx
    8cf2d8a03c123f8824ac46aa20a6b924ad44f0c8
    ```
- **Locate the stored object:**

    ```bash
    ls .git/objects/e6/
    ```
    Output:
    ```nginx
    9de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391
    ```

- **This command **stores the content** in `.git/objects/` and assigns a SHA-1 hash.**

## Understanding the `.git` Directory Structure

When a Git repository is initialized (git init), a .git directory is created to manage version history and metadata.

### Tree Structure of a Freshly Initialized Git Repository
```
.git
├── HEAD
├── branches
├── config
├── description
├── index
├── hooks/
│   ├── pre-commit.sample
│   ├── pre-push.sample
│   ├── post-update.sample
│   └── (other hook samples)
├── info/
│   ├── exclude
├── objects/
│   ├── info/
│   ├── pack/
├── refs/
│   ├── heads/
│   ├── tags/
└── logs/
```

### Detailed Breakdown of `.git` Subdirectories
| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `HEAD` | Stores reference to the current branch. |
| `branches/` | (Legacy) Used for alternative branch management. |	
| `config` | Stores repository-level Git settings. |
| `description` | Used for descriptions in GitWeb interfaces (rarely used). |
| `hooks/` | Contains scripts for automation (pre-commit, post-push, etc.). |
| `info/` | Contains exclude, which defines ignored files (similar to .gitignore). |
| `objects/` | Contains all Git objects (blobs, trees, commits, tags). |
| `refs/` | Stores branch (`heads/`) and tag (`tags/`) references. |
---

## The Importance of the `objects/` Directory

The `objects/` folder is the heart of Git’s key-value store, containing all historical content as hashed objects.

### Structure of `.git/objects/`
```
.git/objects
├── info
├── pack
└── (hashed objects, e.g., 2e/a1f2b3c4d5e6…)
```

### Types of Objects Stored in `objects/`
Git stores four object types, all identified by SHA-1 hashes:


| Object Type | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **Blob** | Stores file contents without metadata (not filenames). |
| **Tree** | Represents a directory structure (contains pointers to blobs and trees). |
| **Commit** | Points to a tree object and includes metadata (author, message, parent commit, etc.). |
| **Tag** | Stores tag data and references commits (annotated tags).|

### Example: Storing and Retrieving a File Manually
```bash
echo "Hello Git Internals!" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```
Output:
```nginx
8cf2d8a03c123f8824ac46aa20a6b924ad44f0c8
```
Now, retrieve the content:

```bash
git cat-file -p <hash>
```
Output:
```nginx
Hello, Git Internals!
```

## Advanced Git Internals: Reconstructing a Commit

### Step 1: Write a Blob (File Content)
```bash
 echo "My first file" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```
Output:
```nginx
 b173a9e4f6222fa923abc3ee10d4e7a2f4e4a16e
```

### Step 2: Write a Tree Object
```bash
git write-tree
```
Output:
```nginx
 9a3e5b4d8a6c7f12e6aef3c1b2e5c4d1a9a8c7e6
```

* The tree object represents a directory structure and references blob objects.

### Step 3: Create a Commit
```bash
 echo "Initial commit" | git commit-tree 9a3e5b4d8a6c7f12e6aef3c1b2e5c4d1a9a8c7e6 -m "Initial commit"
```
Output:
```nginx
 d2f3a5e4b6c2a1e7d8c9b0e2f3a7c6d5e4b3a2e1
```
* This manually creates a commit object!
